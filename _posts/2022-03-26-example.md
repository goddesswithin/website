This is an example post. 

Anything in the `_posts` folder with a date in the filename gets treated by Jekyll as a post. 

Jekyll can update any other pages that reference posts, such as the homepage or a feed. 

One benefit of markdown is that HTML can still be included. So, for example, you can paste in the embed code from a YouTube video, and it will still work.
