This is an example post. 

Anything in the [`_posts`][posts folder] folder with a date in the filename gets treated by Jekyll as a post. 

Jekyll can update any other pages that reference posts, such as the homepage or a feed. 

One benefit of markdown is that HTML can still be included. So, for example, you can copy and paste in the embed code from a YouTube video, and it will still work.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dWtquu_07DU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
