title: Hey, it's a guest post!

This is an example of contributing a new post. Someone can make a request to add this file to the repository. 

If the request is approved, the website will be rebuilt with it included, and it will appear in any list of posts.

The other benefit is that it does not matter how they write it. They can write it on GitHub.com, or in their favorite text editor.

And it supports all of the **formatting** of *Markdown*!

One of the downsides is that GitHub doesn't generate a preview of the website with this page included. People who approve 
requests to alter the code will likely need to know how to generate a preview on their own computers.
